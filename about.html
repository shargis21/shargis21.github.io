          <p class="paragraph-3">I’m Shannon. I’m a designer and developer who delights in finding imaginative solutions for complex problems and transforming ideas from good to great. I’ve worked on a diverse slate of industries ranging from industrial to tourism to nonprofits to hospitality, and just about everything in between. I specialize in branding and identity, web and digital design, editorial layout, iconography, HTML, CSS, Javascript, UI/UX design, and motion graphic video design.<br><br>I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Public Relations and Marketing and a certificate in Front-end Web Development from Seattle University. Born and bred in the South, I shifted sights to Washington State for the mountains, the water, and the beer. In my spare time, I enjoy camping, roller skating, scuba diving, and listening to live music. My secret to the universe is a glass of freshly brewed sweet tea. I’m available for freelance and contract work and am always looking to collaborate with others on interesting projects!</p>
